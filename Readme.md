# Grid Template Areas - Certification Project

## Overview
This project is part of the certification requirements. In this exercise, I created a layout using **CSS Grid Template Areas**, a powerful feature of CSS Grid that allows for semantic, readable layout definitions.

The goal of the project is to build a visually clean and responsive layout using named grid areas, enhancing both code clarity and layout flexibility.

## Project Details
- **Project Type**: Web Page Layout Design
- **Purpose**: Learn how to define and manage grid structures using `grid-template-areas` in CSS.
- **Skills Learned**: CSS Grid, grid-area naming, responsive layout design, visual hierarchy

## Features
- 🧱 **Named Layout Sections**: Clearly defined areas such as `header`, `sidebar`, `main`, `footer`, etc.
- 🧭 **Easy-to-Read Layouts**: Grid template areas provide a more intuitive overview of the layout structure.
- 📱 **Responsive Design**: Used media queries with `grid-template-areas` to reflow layout for smaller screens.
- 🎨 **Custom Styling**: Styled each section with individual colors, spacing, and content alignment.
- 🧩 **Semantic Structure**: HTML elements are mapped directly to CSS areas, making code maintenance easier.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Semantic markup for layout sections
- **CSS**: CSS Grid, grid-area, `grid-template-areas`, and media queries
